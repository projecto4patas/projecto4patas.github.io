    <h1>About Projecto 4 Patas</h1>
    
    <p>Projecto 4 Patas is an independent research collective focused on exploring the philosophical, technical, and social implications of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. Our work bridges the gap between academic research and practical applications, offering pragmatic perspectives on complex technological challenges.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    
    <p>We believe that the future of AI development requires careful consideration of both technical capabilities and their broader implications for society. Our research aims to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Provide thoughtful analysis of AI development trends and their implications</li>
        <li>Challenge conventional assumptions about intelligence, agency, and technological progress</li>
        <li>Offer practical frameworks for understanding and managing advanced AI systems</li>
        <li>Foster dialogue between technical researchers, policymakers, and the broader public</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Research Areas</h2>
    
    <p>Our research encompasses several key areas:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Safety and Alignment</strong>: Examining approaches to ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and controllable</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Science and AI</strong>: Exploring the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophy of Mind and Technology</strong>: Investigating fundamental questions about consciousness, intelligence, and agency</li>
        <li><strong>Sociotechnical Systems</strong>: Analyzing how AI systems interact with human institutions and social structures</li>
        <li><strong>Pragmatic AI Ethics</strong>: Developing practical frameworks for ethical AI development and deployment</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Publications</h2>
    
    <p>Our research is published through various channels, including academic papers, technical reports, and blog posts. We believe in making our work accessible to diverse audiences, from technical researchers to policymakers and the general public.</p>
    
    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    
    <p>We welcome collaboration with researchers, institutions, and organizations working on related topics. Our interdisciplinary approach brings together perspectives from computer science, cognitive science, philosophy, and social sciences.</p>
