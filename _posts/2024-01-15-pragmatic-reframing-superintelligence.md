## Abstract

The contemporary discourse on superintelligence has been dominated by philosophical assumptions about unbounded intelligence and exponential capability growth. This paper argues for a fundamental re-framing of superintelligence from abstract intelligence measures to concrete agentic capabilities. By examining the foundational axioms underlying current superintelligence theory, we propose that the critical factor is not intelligence per se, but the ability to effectively act upon and transform the world—what we term "agentic capability." This shift in perspective has profound implications for both AGI development and safety considerations.

## Introduction

The debate surrounding artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence has created an unusual intellectual landscape where pragmatic safety researchers and philosophical skeptics often find themselves in unexpected agreement. Both camps recognize the need to move beyond abstract theorizing toward concrete, implementable frameworks for understanding and managing advanced AI systems.

The traditional superintelligence narrative, popularized by philosophers like Nick Bostrom, posits that once AI systems reach human-level intelligence, they will rapidly progress to vastly superhuman levels through recursive self-improvement. This narrative assumes that intelligence is a scalar quantity that can be meaningfully compared across different systems and that higher intelligence directly translates to greater power and capability.

However, this framework may be fundamentally flawed. Recent developments in AI research suggest that intelligence is not a simple scalar but a complex multidimensional phenomenon. More importantly, the relationship between intelligence and real-world capability is mediated by numerous factors including embodiment, training data, computational resources, and environmental constraints.

## The Critique of Foundational Axioms

### The Scalar Intelligence Assumption

The first problematic assumption in traditional superintelligence discourse is that intelligence can be meaningfully measured on a single scale. This assumption underlies claims about "human-level" AI and predictions about exponential intelligence growth. However, cognitive science and AI research increasingly suggest that intelligence is better understood as a collection of specialized capabilities rather than a general-purpose problem-solving ability.

Consider the performance of modern large language models. These systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and even creative tasks. Yet they lack basic competencies that even simple animals possess, such as persistent memory, learning from individual experiences, or understanding of physical causation. This suggests that intelligence is not a unified phenomenon but rather a collection of specialized tools and representations.

### The Recursive Self-Improvement Hypothesis

The second major assumption is that intelligent systems will naturally engage in recursive self-improvement, leading to an "intelligence explosion." This hypothesis depends on several questionable premises:

1. **Optimization Targets**: The assumption that AI systems will be motivated to improve their own intelligence presupposes particular goal structures and optimization targets.

2. **Diminishing Returns**: The hypothesis often ignores the possibility of diminishing returns in intelligence improvement, both in terms of computational resources and the fundamental limits of information processing.

3. **Environmental Constraints**: Real-world intelligence operates within physical and computational constraints that may limit the scope for recursive improvement.

### The Intelligence-Power Equation

Perhaps most critically, the traditional framework assumes a direct relationship between intelligence and power. This assumption underlies fears about superintelligent systems rapidly acquiring world-changing capabilities. However, the relationship between intelligence and effective action is mediated by numerous factors:

- **Embodiment**: Intelligence requires physical instantiation and interaction with the world
- **Resources**: Capability depends on access to computational, material, and social resources
- **Coordination**: Complex goals require coordination across multiple agents and systems
- **Knowledge**: Effective action requires not just intelligence but also domain-specific knowledge

## The Primacy of Agentic Capability

### Defining Agentic Capability

Rather than focusing on abstract intelligence measures, we propose that the critical factor in advanced AI systems is **agentic capability**—the ability to form goals, make plans, and execute actions that effectively transform the world in accordance with those goals. Agentic capability encompasses several key components:

1. **Goal Formation**: The ability to generate and evaluate objectives
2. **Planning**: The capacity to construct multi-step strategies for achieving goals
3. **Execution**: The skill to carry out plans in complex, dynamic environments
4. **Learning**: The ability to improve performance through experience
5. **Adaptation**: The capacity to modify goals and strategies in response to changing circumstances

### The Multidimensional Nature of Agency

Agentic capability is inherently multidimensional. An agent might be highly capable in one domain while remaining limited in others. This multidimensionality has several important implications:

- **Specialized Competence**: Advanced AI systems are likely to exhibit highly specialized rather than general capabilities
- **Contextual Performance**: Agentic capability depends heavily on the specific environment and domain
- **Complementary Systems**: Different AI systems may have complementary capabilities that become powerful when combined

### Embodied Intelligence and Environmental Coupling

The concept of agentic capability emphasizes the importance of embodiment and environmental coupling. Intelligence is not an abstract property of information processing systems but emerges from the interaction between agents and their environments. This perspective aligns with insights from embodied cognition research and robotics, which demonstrate that intelligence is fundamentally shaped by physical and social contexts.

## Implications for AGI Development

### Architecture Over Philosophy

The shift from abstract intelligence to agentic capability suggests that AGI development should focus on architectural questions rather than philosophical debates about consciousness or general intelligence. Key architectural considerations include:

1. **Modular Design**: Systems composed of specialized modules rather than monolithic general-purpose architectures
2. **Environmental Interaction**: Emphasis on systems that can effectively perceive and act in complex environments
3. **Learning Mechanisms**: Development of systems that can acquire new capabilities through experience
4. **Goal Alignment**: Ensuring that goal formation and modification processes align with human values

### Incremental Capability Development

Rather than expecting sudden jumps to superhuman performance, the agentic capability framework suggests that advanced AI will develop incrementally through the gradual expansion of domain-specific competencies. This has several advantages:

- **Predictable Development**: Incremental improvement is more predictable than exponential growth
- **Testing and Validation**: Capabilities can be tested and validated in controlled environments
- **Safety Measures**: Safety protocols can be developed and refined alongside capability development

### The Role of Human-AI Collaboration

The focus on agentic capability also highlights the importance of human-AI collaboration. Rather than viewing AI as potential competitors or threats, the framework suggests that the most powerful systems will emerge from effective collaboration between human and artificial agents. This collaboration leverages the complementary strengths of both types of agents:

- **Human Strengths**: Contextual understanding, value judgment, creative insight
- **AI Strengths**: Computational power, pattern recognition, systematic analysis

## Implications for AI Safety

### From Control to Alignment

The traditional superintelligence framework has led to safety approaches focused on controlling powerful AI systems. However, the agentic capability framework suggests that safety is better achieved through alignment—ensuring that AI systems' goal formation and decision-making processes are compatible with human values and intentions.

This shift has several important implications:

1. **Value Learning**: Systems must be able to learn and adapt to human values rather than merely following fixed rules
2. **Cooperative Goal Setting**: Safety emerges from collaborative goal setting between humans and AI systems
3. **Transparent Decision Making**: AI systems should be able to explain their goals and decision-making processes

### Distributed Safety

The multidimensional nature of agentic capability suggests that safety should be distributed across multiple levels:

- **Individual System Safety**: Each AI system should be designed with appropriate safety measures
- **Interaction Safety**: Safety protocols for interactions between different AI systems
- **Ecosystem Safety**: Governance structures for managing the broader AI ecosystem

### Capability Monitoring and Assessment

The agentic capability framework provides a more concrete foundation for monitoring and assessing AI capabilities. Rather than attempting to measure abstract intelligence, researchers can focus on specific agentic capabilities such as:

- **Planning Horizon**: The time scale over which systems can effectively plan and act
- **Domain Transfer**: The ability to apply capabilities across different domains
- **Goal Complexity**: The sophistication of goals that systems can pursue
- **Environmental Adaptability**: The range of environments in which systems can operate effectively

## Conclusion

The re-framing of superintelligence from abstract intelligence to agentic capability provides a more solid foundation for both AGI development and safety research. By focusing on concrete capabilities rather than philosophical abstractions, researchers can develop more effective approaches to building and managing advanced AI systems.

This framework suggests that the path to advanced AI is likely to be more gradual and predictable than traditional superintelligence narratives suggest. Rather than sudden jumps to superhuman performance, we should expect incremental development of specialized capabilities that gradually expand to cover broader domains.

Most importantly, the agentic capability framework emphasizes the importance of collaboration between humans and AI systems. The most powerful and beneficial AI systems will likely emerge from effective human-AI partnerships that leverage the complementary strengths of both types of agents.

The shift from philosophy to architecture, from control to alignment, and from abstract intelligence to concrete capability represents a maturation of AI research and safety thinking. By grounding our discussions in concrete, measurable phenomena, we can move beyond speculative debates toward practical solutions for the challenges of advanced AI development.
