## Abstract

This paper examines the philosophical assumptions underlying contemporary superintelligence discourse, particularly the axiom of unbounded intelligence scaling and its implications for artificial general intelligence (AGI) development. We argue that the traditional framing of superintelligence as primarily an intelligence amplification problem obscures more practical concerns about agentic capability - the capacity for autonomous goal-directed behavior in complex environments. Drawing from cognitive science, distributed systems theory, and pragmatic philosophy, we propose a reframing that prioritizes agentic capability over abstract intelligence metrics. This perspective suggests that the most significant risks and opportunities in AGI development lie not in raw computational power or problem-solving capacity, but in the emergence of robust, adaptable agency that can navigate real-world complexity. We conclude that this reframing has significant implications for both AGI safety research and development priorities, suggesting a shift from philosophical speculation about intelligence explosions to architectural considerations about agent design and deployment.

## 1. Introduction

The discourse surrounding artificial superintelligence has been dominated by two primary camps: those who view AGI as an existential threat requiring immediate safety measures, and those who remain skeptical about the feasibility or timeline of such systems. Both perspectives, however, share a common assumption that superintelligence is fundamentally about intelligence amplification - the scaling of cognitive capabilities beyond human levels. This paper argues that this shared assumption may be misguided, and that a more pragmatic approach to understanding AGI risks and opportunities lies in examining agentic capability rather than abstract intelligence.

The traditional superintelligence narrative, popularized by philosophers like Nick Bostrom and Stuart Russell, posits that once artificial systems reach human-level intelligence, they will rapidly surpass human cognitive abilities across all domains, leading to what has been termed an "intelligence explosion." This framing has generated significant concern about alignment problems, control mechanisms, and the potential for catastrophic outcomes. Conversely, skeptics like Rodney Brooks and Yann LeCun have argued that such scenarios are overly speculative and that the challenges of creating truly intelligent systems are more fundamental than commonly assumed.

We propose bridging these perspectives by shifting focus from intelligence as a scalar quantity to agency as a multifaceted capability. This reframing acknowledges the legitimate concerns about powerful AI systems while grounding the discussion in more concrete, architecturally-relevant considerations. Rather than debating the likelihood of intelligence explosions, we can examine the specific capabilities required for autonomous agents to operate effectively in complex, real-world environments.

## 2. Critique of Foundational Axioms

### 2.1 The Unbounded Intelligence Assumption

The superintelligence discourse rests on several questionable axioms, the most fundamental being the assumption that intelligence can be meaningfully scaled without limit. This assumption treats intelligence as a linear, quantifiable property that can be amplified through computational power, algorithmic improvements, or architectural innovations. However, this view conflicts with several observations from cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.

First, human intelligence appears to be highly specialized and context-dependent rather than general-purpose. The cognitive abilities that allow humans to excel in specific domains often involve domain-specific heuristics, embodied knowledge, and cultural scaffolding that may not generalize to other contexts. The idea that these capabilities can be abstracted into a domain-general intelligence measure that scales linearly is questionable.

Second, the relationship between computational resources and intelligent behavior appears to be subject to diminishing returns. While increased computational power can improve performance on specific tasks, the relationship is rarely linear and often plateaus. The scaling laws observed in current large language models, while impressive, may not extend indefinitely, and the leap from pattern recognition to genuine understanding remains unclear.

### 2.2 The Single-Agent Fallacy

Much of the superintelligence discourse assumes that AGI will emerge as a single, unified agent with coherent goals and capabilities. This assumption leads to concerns about the agent's potential for rapid self-improvement and the difficulty of maintaining human control over such a system. However, this framing may be artificially constraining our understanding of how advanced AI systems might actually develop.

Real-world intelligence, both biological and artificial, is increasingly understood as distributed and multi-agent in nature. Human cognition involves multiple neural systems operating in parallel, often with conflicting objectives. Similarly, most successful AI systems today are composed of multiple specialized components working together. The assumption that superintelligence must take the form of a single, unified agent may be preventing us from considering more realistic architectures based on distributed intelligence and multi-agent coordination.

### 2.3 The Optimization Pressure Assumption

The superintelligence narrative often assumes that advanced AI systems will be subject to extreme optimization pressure, leading to rapid capability improvements and potentially dangerous instrumental convergence. This assumption treats AI development as a purely technical optimization problem, ignoring the social, economic, and institutional factors that shape technology development.

In reality, the development of advanced AI systems is embedded in complex sociotechnical systems with competing objectives, resource constraints, and regulatory frameworks. The assumption that AI development will proceed according to pure optimization logic ignores these constraining factors and may lead to unrealistic scenarios about the pace and direction of progress.

## 3. The Primacy of Agentic Capability

### 3.1 Defining Agentic Capability

We define agentic capability as the capacity for autonomous goal-directed behavior in complex, uncertain environments. This definition encompasses several key components:

**Autonomy**: The ability to operate independently without constant human oversight or intervention. This includes both decision-making autonomy and behavioral autonomy.

**Goal-directedness**: The capacity to pursue objectives over extended time horizons, adapting strategies as circumstances change while maintaining coherent purpose.

**Environmental competence**: The ability to navigate and manipulate complex, real-world environments, including physical spaces, social contexts, and digital ecosystems.

**Adaptability**: The capacity to adjust behavior in response to changing conditions, unexpected obstacles, or novel situations.

**Robustness**: The ability to maintain function in the face of partial failures, incomplete information, or adversarial conditions.

### 3.2 Why Agency Matters More Than Intelligence

The focus on agentic capability over abstract intelligence has several advantages for understanding AGI development and risks:

**Practical Relevance**: Agentic capability directly relates to the practical impact that AI systems can have on the world. An agent with limited intelligence but strong agentic capabilities may be more consequential than a highly intelligent system with limited agency.

**Architectural Implications**: Focusing on agency directs attention to specific architectural choices about sensing, planning, execution, and adaptation. These are concrete engineering challenges rather than abstract philosophical problems.

**Measurable Progress**: Unlike intelligence, which remains difficult to define and measure precisely, agentic capabilities can be evaluated through performance in specific environments and tasks.

**Risk Assessment**: The risks associated with advanced AI systems are more clearly understood in terms of what they can do (agentic capability) rather than how smart they are (intelligence level).

### 3.3 The Emergence of Robust Agency

Current AI systems demonstrate impressive performance on specific tasks but lack robust agency. Large language models can generate coherent text but cannot autonomously pursue goals in complex environments. Robotics systems can perform sophisticated manipulation tasks but require careful engineering for specific contexts. The emergence of robust agency - the ability to pursue goals autonomously across diverse, unpredictable environments - represents a qualitative shift in AI capabilities.

This shift is not primarily about intelligence amplification but about the integration of multiple capabilities into coherent, adaptive systems. The challenge is not making AI systems smarter in the abstract, but making them more capable of independent action in the real world.

## 4. Implications for AGI Development

### 4.1 Architectural Considerations

The reframing toward agentic capability has several implications for AGI architecture:

**Modular Design**: Rather than pursuing monolithic superintelligent systems, developers should focus on modular architectures that can be more easily understood, tested, and controlled.

**Distributed Intelligence**: AGI systems should be designed as networks of specialized agents rather than single unified entities, enabling better fault tolerance and more manageable scaling.

**Environmental Grounding**: AGI development should prioritize systems that are deeply embedded in and responsive to their environments, rather than abstract reasoning systems.

**Incremental Deployment**: The focus on agency suggests that AGI capabilities should be developed and deployed incrementally, allowing for testing and refinement in constrained environments before broader deployment.

### 4.2 Development Priorities

This reframing suggests several priority areas for AGI development:

**Robust Planning**: Developing systems that can plan effectively under uncertainty, with incomplete information, and in dynamic environments.

**Adaptive Execution**: Creating systems that can adapt their behavior in real-time as conditions change, while maintaining coherent goal pursuit.

**Multi-agent Coordination**: Developing architectures that enable effective coordination between multiple AI agents and between AI agents and humans.

**Environmental Integration**: Building systems that can operate effectively in complex, real-world environments rather than simplified laboratory conditions.

### 4.3 Safety Considerations

The focus on agentic capability also has important implications for AI safety:

**Containment Strategies**: Safety measures should focus on limiting agentic capabilities in testing and deployment rather than trying to solve theoretical alignment problems.

**Monitoring and Control**: Emphasis should be placed on developing robust monitoring systems that can track agent behavior and intervention mechanisms that can modify or halt problematic actions.

**Gradual Scaling**: Safety testing should focus on incremental increases in agentic capability rather than attempting to solve alignment problems for hypothetical superintelligent systems.

**Institutional Frameworks**: Safety measures should include institutional and regulatory frameworks that can respond to emerging agentic capabilities rather than relying solely on technical solutions.

## 5. Implications for AI Safety Research

### 5.1 Shifting Research Priorities

The reframing toward agentic capability suggests several shifts in AI safety research priorities:

**From Alignment to Monitoring**: Rather than focusing primarily on pre-deployment alignment, safety research should emphasize real-time monitoring and intervention capabilities.

**From Theoretical to Empirical**: Safety research should prioritize empirical studies of agent behavior in realistic environments over theoretical analyses of idealized scenarios.

**From Single-agent to Multi-agent**: Safety research should focus on the challenges of coordinating multiple AI agents and managing interactions between AI systems and human institutions.

**From Prevention to Response**: Safety frameworks should emphasize rapid response to emerging problems rather than attempting to prevent all possible failures in advance.

### 5.2 Practical Safety Measures

This reframing suggests several practical safety measures:

**Capability Assessment**: Developing standardized methods for assessing agentic capabilities across different domains and environments.

**Behavioral Modeling**: Creating models that can predict agent behavior in novel situations based on training and deployment history.

**Intervention Mechanisms**: Developing technical and institutional mechanisms for intervening in agent behavior when problems arise.

**Gradual Deployment**: Implementing frameworks for gradual, monitored deployment of agents with increasing capabilities.

## 6. Addressing Potential Objections

### 6.1 The Intelligence Explosion Objection

Critics might argue that our focus on agentic capability ignores the possibility of recursive self-improvement leading to rapid intelligence gains. We acknowledge this possibility but argue that even in such scenarios, the practical impact depends on agentic capability rather than abstract intelligence. A system that can improve its own intelligence but lacks robust agency may be less consequential than a system with strong agentic capabilities and modest intelligence.

Furthermore, the assumption that intelligence improvements will automatically translate to improved agency may be unfounded. The skills required for self-modification may be quite different from those required for effective action in complex environments.

### 6.2 The Measurement Problem

Some may argue that agentic capability is as difficult to measure as intelligence, making our proposed reframing impractical. While we acknowledge measurement challenges, we argue that agentic capability is more amenable to empirical evaluation than abstract intelligence. Agent performance can be assessed through behavior in specific environments, goal achievement across various contexts, and adaptation to changing conditions.

### 6.3 The Scope Limitation Objection

Critics might argue that focusing on agentic capability artificially limits our consideration of AI risks and opportunities. We argue that this focus actually broadens the scope of consideration by including social, institutional, and environmental factors that are often overlooked in purely intelligence-focused analyses. The agency perspective requires considering AI systems as embedded in complex sociotechnical systems rather than as isolated cognitive entities.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper has argued for a pragmatic reframing of superintelligence discourse from abstract intelligence to agentic capability. Rather than focusing on hypothetical intelligence explosions or abstract alignment problems, we suggest that the most significant challenges and opportunities in AGI development lie in creating robust, adaptable agents that can operate effectively in complex, real-world environments.

This reframing has several advantages: it grounds the discussion in concrete, architecturally-relevant considerations; it provides clearer metrics for assessing progress and risks; it suggests practical approaches to safety and development; and it bridges the gap between safety-focused and skeptical perspectives on AGI.

The implications of this reframing extend beyond academic discourse to practical considerations about research priorities, development strategies, and safety measures. Rather than preparing for abstract superintelligence, we should focus on understanding and managing the emergence of robust agency in AI systems.

We conclude that the path forward requires shifting focus from philosophical speculation about intelligence explosions to architectural considerations about agent design, deployment, and integration into human systems. This shift represents not a retreat from the challenges of advanced AI, but a more pragmatic approach to understanding and addressing those challenges.

The question is not whether machines will become superintelligent, but how we will create and manage artificial agents that can operate effectively and safely in the complex world we inhabit. This reframing provides a more concrete foundation for addressing that challenge.
