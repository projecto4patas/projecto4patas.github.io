            <h1>About Projecto 4 Patas</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Welcome to Projecto 4 Patas, a thoughtful exploration of artificial intelligence, philosophy, and the future of intelligence itself. Our mission is to bridge the gap between abstract theoretical discussions and practical considerations in AI development and safety.</p>

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            
            <p>We believe that the most productive discussions about AI happen at the intersection of rigorous academic thinking and pragmatic engineering considerations. Rather than getting lost in philosophical speculation, we focus on concrete questions that can inform both AI research and policy decisions.</p>

            <h3>Core Areas of Focus</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Safety and Alignment:</strong> Exploring practical approaches to ensuring AI systems remain beneficial and aligned with human values</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophical Foundations:</strong> Examining the assumptions underlying AI research and superintelligence discourse</li>
                <li><strong>Capability Assessment:</strong> Developing frameworks for understanding and measuring AI capabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration:</strong> Investigating how humans and AI systems can work together effectively</li>
                <li><strong>Governance and Policy:</strong> Analyzing the regulatory and ethical frameworks needed for advanced AI systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Perspective</h2>
            
            <p>We advocate for a pragmatic approach to AI development that emphasizes:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>The primacy of agentic capability over abstract intelligence measures, the importance of incremental progress over exponential leaps, and the necessity of human-AI collaboration over adversarial relationships.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This perspective informs our analysis of everything from technical AI research to policy proposals, always asking: "What are the practical implications of this idea, and how can we test it in the real world?"</p>

            <h2>Academic Rigor</h2>
            
            <p>Our work is grounded in rigorous academic research while remaining accessible to practitioners and policymakers. We engage with the latest developments in AI research, cognitive science, philosophy, and related fields to provide informed analysis and commentary.</p>

            <h2>Join the Conversation</h2>
            
            <p>We welcome thoughtful engagement with our ideas. Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, policymaker, or simply someone interested in the future of AI, we invite you to explore our articles and join the discussion.</p>

            <p>The future of AI is too important to leave to any single discipline or perspective. By bringing together insights from multiple fields and viewpoints, we can work toward AI systems that are both powerful and beneficial.</p>
